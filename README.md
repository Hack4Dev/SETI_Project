# Search for Extraterrestrial Signals

## Description

The goal of this tutorial is to take you through the "SETI Pipeline", that is the method used by the [Breakthrough Listen](https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/) team to search for alien techno-signatures! You will take real data gathered by Breakthrough Listen at the [Green Bank Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bank_Telescope) in West Virginia, run it through a few algorithms, and see if you can find an alien or two!

Spoiler alert: If you do everything right you WILL find what appears to possibly be an alien! 👽

Second spoiler alert: It's not an alien 😔

But it is Voyager 1! 🛰️ The farthest human-made object from Earth! Which is still pretty freaking awesome if you ask me!

**The process by which we find Voyager 1 will be nearly identical to the process you will use to search for aliens in other data sets.** So buckle up and listen close: It's time to look for ET!

One of the largest challenges in SETI's search is that human-generated radio frequency interference (RFI) from cell phones, Wi-Fi, radar, etc, is much more abundant and powerful than potential alien-generated signals. Therefore two primary techniques are used to quickly discriminate between human-made RFI and signals from outer space. They're pretty simple, effective, and understanding them is prerequisite for the rest of this tutorial. For a more thorough background discussion, [read through this document](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/breakthrough/tree/master/GBT).

This project does not make use of machine learning and therefore can be run locally on your computer.

## Data



## Hackathon Task



## Prerequisites

All the libraries/dependencies necessary to run the tutorials are listed in the [requirements.txt](@) file.


## Installation

All the required libraries can be installed using pip and the [requirements.txt](@) file in the repo:

```bash

```

### Would you like to clone this repository? Feel free!

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Hack4Dev/SETI_Project.git
```

Then make sure you have the right Python libraries for the tutorials. 


### New to Github?

The easiest way to get all of the lecture and tutorial material is to clone this repository. To do this you need git installed on your laptop. If you're working on Linux you can install git using apt-get (you might need to use sudo):

```
apt install git
```

You can then clone the repository by typing:

```
git clone https://github.com/Hack4Dev/SETI_Project.git
```

To update your clone if changes are made, use:

```
cd SETI_Project/
git pull
```
